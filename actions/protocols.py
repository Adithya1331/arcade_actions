"""Typed capability protocols for the ArcadeActions framework.

These lightweight ``typing.Protocol`` classes express *capabilities* that an
object may support (movement, composition, grouping, â€¦).  They enable static
analysis and self-documentation while **avoiding** the need for runtime
``isinstance`` / ``hasattr`` inspection â€“ aligning with the project rule of
ZERO TOLERANCE for such checks.

The protocols are intentionally minimal: they only include the methods that
other framework components already *call* on their collaborators.  Feel free
to extend **sparingly** when new capabilities are required.

No concrete classes are required to *inherit* from these protocols â€“ static
type checkers rely on *structural* sub-typing, so any class with matching
attributes will satisfy the protocol automatically.
