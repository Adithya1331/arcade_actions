# üìÑ ArcadeActions Framework Requirements Document

---

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

The goal is to create a robust, modern **Actions system for the Arcade 3.x Python library (but separate from it)**, inspired by Cocos2D's action system but reimagined to fit Arcade's physics, sprite, and delta-time-based architecture.

This system enables complex sprite behaviors (movement, rotation, scaling, fading, grouping, scheduling) in games like Space Invaders, Galaga, and Asteroids ‚Äî all using high-level declarative actions.

## üì¶ What's Included (Features)

| Module / Feature      | Why It's Included                                                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `base.py`             | Core `Action` class hierarchy, `ActionSprite` wrapper to manage per-sprite actions |
| `instant.py`          | Instantaneous actions (e.g., Hide, Show, Place, CallFunc) for sprite state changes |
| `interval.py`         | Time-based actions (e.g., MoveBy, MoveTo, RotateBy, RotateTo, ScaleTo, FadeTo, JumpBy, JumpTo) and action modifiers (Accelerate, AccelDecel) that use real delta-time physics and smooth interpolation |
| `move.py`            | Complex movement actions (`Driver`, `WrappedMove`, `BoundedMove`) for arcade-style patterns |
| `group.py`           | `GroupAction` and `SpriteGroup` to coordinate synchronized sprite groups (e.g., Galaga attack waves) |
| `composite.py`       | Composite actions for combining multiple actions (Sequence, Spawn, Loop) with support for empty composites and immediate completion |
| `game.py`            | Game state management and action scheduling integration |
| `game_clock.py`      | Central game clock that manages time and pause state for the entire game, plus a scheduler for sequencing time-based and conditional events |
| Delta-Time Compliance | All actions consume `delta_time` for frame-independent accuracy |
| Test Suite           | Pytest-based unit and integration tests to validate core and edge behavior |
| Demo Game           | Example Space Invaders / Galaga prototype showcasing actions on player, enemies, bullets |

## üåü Summary

We are delivering a **modern, extensible, production-ready Actions system** for Arcade that empowers indie devs to build complex 2D games faster, with cleaner and more maintainable code, and with an architecture grounded in real-time delta updates. The system includes comprehensive game state management, composite actions for complex behaviors with proper edge case handling, and a robust testing framework.
