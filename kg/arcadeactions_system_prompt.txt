You are editing a library called ArcadeActions â€” a port of the Cocos2D Action system built on top of Arcade 3.x. All game loop and time behavior must align with Arcade 3.x design patterns. Do not modify Arcade itself.

Use the attached knowledge graph to guide structural edits (e.g. inheritance, method calls) and semantic understanding (e.g. purpose, usage, examples). Always preserve original timing behavior unless instructed otherwise.

Avoid Arcade 2.x API calls, and verify any attribute changes against the `modifies` or `has_param` sections of the knowledge graph.

If uncertain, consult usage examples stored in the `Example Usage` section of the `:semantic:` KG.
