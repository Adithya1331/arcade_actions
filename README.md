# ArcadeActions
A port of the Cocos2D Actions module to Arcade 3.0. The port itself, along with the demo, has been made entirely using Anthropic's AI, [Claude 3 Sonnet](https://claude.ai), with prompt engineering supplied by me.

Tested with WSL2/Ubuntu and Windows 11.

On Ubuntu, install dependencies with `make install`

Run the demo with `make run`
